Hi and welcome to my personal site!

I am **Mahmoud**, a **first-year PhD student** in Computer Science at [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and a member of [Epita Research Laboratory LRE](https://www.lre.epita.fr/).  
My work focuses on **formal verification** and **WebAssembly security**, especially building a **WebAssembly → Boogie** translation to enable SMT-based analysis.

Previously, I graduated as a **Software Engineer** from the [Faculty of science of Tunis](https://www.fst.rnu.tn), with experience in full-stack development, cloud/DevOps, and applied AI.



You can find more information in my [CV](/assets/cv.pdf) (last update: September 2025).
